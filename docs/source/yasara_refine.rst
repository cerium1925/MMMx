YasaraRefine
==========================

This module refines structures of conformers by calling `YASARA structure <http://www.yasara.org/>`_. 
It automates refinement of conformers in raw ensembles and cleans up YASARA output PDB files.

YasaraRefine can have an input argument:

.. code-block:: matlab

    !yasara [maxtime]

Arguments
    *   ``maxtime`` - maximum computation time for a single model in hours, defaults to 1  
Remarks
    *   since the Yasara jobs cannot be killed from Matlab, too short maximum times can result in too many processes

``getpdb``
---------------------------------

Input of a template by reading a single local PDB file or retrieving a PDB structure from a server. 

.. code-block:: matlab

    getpdb file

Arguments
    *   ``file`` - file name or PDB identifier, must have extension '.pdb' if it specifies a file
Remarks
    *   if the template has several conformers, the first one is used
	
``addpdb``
---------------------------------

Input of template conformers from PDB files. 

.. code-block:: matlab

    addpdb file identifier

Arguments
    *   ``file`` - file name, can contain wildcards
    *   ``identifier`` - module-internal identifier for the ensemble, e.g. 'ensemble_1'
Remarks
    *   use wildcard '*' for part of the filename to process all conformers from a previous step in the pipeline 
    *   individual PDB files can contain a single model or several models; this can be freely mixed
    *   use this if you want to refine raw conformers after Flex or FlexRNA calls
	
``getens``
---------------------------------

Input of template conformers from PDB files. 

.. code-block:: matlab

    gentens file identifier

Arguments
    *   ``file`` - name of an MMMx ensemble file list (extension '.ens')
    *   ``identifier`` - module-internal identifier for the ensemble, e.g. 'ensemble_2'
Remarks
    *   use this for refining conformers in an ensemble generated by the EnsembleFit module
    *   if it is affordbale, it is better to refine the raw ensemble before calling the the EnsembleFit module

``save``
---------------------------------

Specifies name for saving an output ensemble list 

.. code-block:: matlab

    save file

Arguments
    *   ``file`` - file name four output ensemble list 
Remarks
    *   extension '.ens' is appended
    *   this has only an effect, if input is an ensemble (key ``getens`` was used)
		
``repack``
---------------------------------

Requests sidechain repacking by SCWRL4 before calling Yasara. 

.. code-block:: matlab

    repack

Remarks
    *   use this if SCWRL4 is available and quality of input conformers might be poor
    *   this is much faster than Yasara, if SCWRL4 is available, it is never wrong to specify this option

``console``
---------------------------------

Requests that Yasara is run in console mode. 

.. code-block:: matlab

    console

Remarks
    *   by default, Yasara is run with full display
    *   for long production runs and for running on a server, console mode saves resources
