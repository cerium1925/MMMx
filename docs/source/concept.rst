Open concept
======================

Open source/ open data concept
---------------------------------------------

All MMMx functions and definitions are open source. Almost all module output is provided or can be requested 
in the file formats that can be read by non-proprietary software. The single exception are rigid-body assemblies
generated by the :ref:`Rigi<rigi>` module, which are output in the form of a Matlab file.

Branched pipeline concept
---------------------------------------------

In general, MMMx modules read and write conformer structures from and into minimal PDB files. Raw ensembles are
sets of such PDB files. Refined and contracted (representative) ensembles are specified by a list of conformer PDB files
with associated populations (:ref:`ensemble list<ensemble_list>`). This allows for replacing any module of MMMx by
third-party software that can fulfil the same task and to feed MMMx output at any point of a modeling pipeline
into other software.
