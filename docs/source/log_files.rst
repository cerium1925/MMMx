Log files
====================

Modelling in MMMx generates log files. These plain text files report key results, 
information on progress of the computation, and warnings or error messages. For longer computations it may
be useful to check the logfile during the computation to assess progress.

Large data sets are not written into the log files, but rather saved in Matlab or comma-separated value files.
Output structures are saved in PDB format. Plots can be saved in various graphics formats.
